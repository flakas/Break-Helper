[Break Helper on Chrome Webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dllmmaniogaffdnagcenlnnlbahmlmld)

Break Helper is a simple Chrome extension that periodically reminds you to take a break.

Currently it supports 4 preset rules:

- *20-20-20* - every 20 minutes take a look at an object at least 20 feet (~6 meters) away for 20 seconds;
- *50-10* - take a 10 minute break after 50 minutes of work;
- *Pomodoro* - 25 minutes of work followed by 5 minutes of break time. Read more about it on [pomodorotechnique.com](https://pomodorotechnique.com);
- *Custom* - work and break time intervals can be defined by you!
